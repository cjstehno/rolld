# rolld

A simple polyhedral dice roller (written in dart).

## Build

TBD... normal dart

## Build (native)

In order to build a platform-dependent native executable (windows), run the following:

    dart compile exe bin\rolld.dart -o rolld.exe

The `rolld.exe` will be generated in the project root and may be moved where needed.
